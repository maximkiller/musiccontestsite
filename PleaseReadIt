Hello Ryan Rucker.
How are you?

This is Maxime who works together Daniel Lee.
Do you remember Daniel Lee who worked with at Upwork before?
I attached screenshot to help reminder him.
You are not professional.
Daniel worked hard for your project, but you didn’t pay him($4k).

I also found you from linkedin. 
So if you don’t make payment to him, then we will start spam action about you.

He said, he has full source code about your projects.
Our action:
1: He will share your source code to git, linkedin, and other social sites.
2: We will post articles of your behavior and bad manner to linkedin and social sites.
Daniel and I has 100+ social friends and they will help Daniel.
3: If possible, we also contact to your company.

All friends will post same articles daily for 30 days or more.
So you can see 400+ articles daily. 

Result:
You and your company’s image will down.
This is your responsibility.

I will wait 48 hrs for your response.
If I don’t get any response within 48 hrs, then we will start action about you.

Regards.
Maxime.
